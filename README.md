Challenge


To solve:
Aims to add an extra layer of security for users accessing various platforms, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access client’s accounts.
Targets to improve convenience over SMS generate code as it only generates OTP directly to their devices.
Users will manage multiple accounts within a single app.


Will not solve:
Will not solve weakly set compromised passwords.
Won’t solve all threats as users still to stay vigilant against cyber threats.


User:
Strictly to anyone looking forward to enhancing their security.


NOTE: not dependent
Risks


Users could be unable to authenticate themselves due to OTP time out or service outage.


Solution: Backup with an alternative authentication method in case the service fails


Infrastructure


Note: Coming soon once a team is set and deployment discussed
